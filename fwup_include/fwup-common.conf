#
# +----------------------------+
# | MBR                        |
# +----------------------------+
# | Firmware configuration data|
# | (formatted as uboot env)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p0*: Boot A (FAT32)        |
# | kernel, device tree,       |
# | config files, etc.         |
# +----------------------------+
# | p0*: Boot B (FAT32)        |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs A (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p1*: Rootfs B (squashfs)   |
# +----------------------------+
# | p2: Application (f2fs)     |
# +----------------------------+
